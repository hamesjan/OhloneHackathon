The base code for the M5 Stick C was provided by the manufacturer itself. We used the given examples and added some of our own functions to the project to make it work.

litFit -> M5StickC -> ENV -> ENV.ino
ENV.ino is the main arduino function file. Open that file and upload it to the M5StickC. All the headders file ablong with any dependencies will be uploaded.

Note - Make sure to change the SSID and Password for the wifi.
